# GitChat

A chatting service on GitHub! Chat through the Issue's tab, I can delete any chat though, so don't say anything that violates these rules:

# Rules
Q: What if I violate the rules?
A: I will kick you for 5 minute's if it's your first time violating the rules, 10 
minute's if it's your second time or ban you from GitChat if it's your third time. And also if you
break a rule bad enough to get banned from GitChat, your GitHub account will also be reported.

I. Don't roast people, GitChat is not for cyberbullying.

II. Don't swear, which will give you an instant ban.

III. Don't pirate software to other's, unless you want to get banned.

IIII. If you somehow do a dangerous explosion on GitChat, prepare for a ban too.

V. Copyrighting is bad! Don't post copyrighted content without the owner's permission first! unless you want to get banned.
